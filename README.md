## Welcome to my GitHub Page
 I am a student who is interested in computer science and mathematics. Specifically, I am interested in distributed computing and non-commutative geometry.
 Currently I am not doing a lot of programming but hopefully in the future I could improve myself and become a high-level computer scientist.
